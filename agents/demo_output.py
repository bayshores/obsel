"""How the demo prints, and how it reads obsel's answers.

Both halves are here because both are guards. Every timing printed by the demo
is measured with `time.perf_counter()` around the thing being timed; nothing
says "instant". And a reply obsel never sent is refused rather than read as an
empty list, because `affected: []` means "nothing downstream was invalidated",
which is the one wrong answer that looks exactly like everything being fine.
